# ðŸ“‚ Uploads Directory

## Overview

This directory temporarily holds files during their upload process to the cloud storage. Files are stored here briefly while they are being processed and then transferred to the cloud.

## Structure

uploads/<br/>
  â””â”€â”€ README.md


## Usage

1. **Upload Handling**: Files uploaded by users are first saved in this directory before being moved to the cloud. This allows for any pre-upload processing such as validation or resizing.
2. **Cleanup**: Files in this directory should be moved to the cloud & then deleted after successful upload. It is essential to implement a cleanup mechanism to avoid accumulation of temporary files.

## Important Considerations

- **Security**: Ensure that files in this directory are not publicly accessible to avoid unauthorized access.
- **Error Handling**: Implement error handling to manage failed uploads and ensure that files in this directory are appropriately removed or retried.
- **File Naming**: Use unique file names to prevent conflicts and ensure traceability.

## Example

Hereâ€™s how a typical file upload might be handled:

1. User uploads a file via your frontend.
2. The backend saves the file temporarily in the `uploads` directory.
3. Perform any necessary processing on the file (e.g., virus scanning, resizing).
4. Transfer the file from `uploads` to your cloud storage.
5. Delete the file from the `uploads` directory after successful upload.

## Permissions

Ensure that the `uploads` directory has appropriate permissions to allow file writing and deletion by the server.
